I'm Paul, a social scientist from the UK, currently living in Houston, Texas. I am in the process of transitioning out of academia to pursue a career in data science and research.
</br></br>
As a political scientist, my research focuses on party and party system change, particularly the development of new political parties in established systems. Beyond comparative politics, I am broadly interested in applying machine learning techniques to modeling human behavior and the social world.
</br></br>
Outside of social science, I am passionate about a variety of topics, including sports analytics. I write for the Borussia Dortmund and Bundesliga website, <a href="https://www.fearthewall.com">Fear The Wall</a>, and am currently working on developing predictive metrics for volleyball.
</br></br>
My skill set combines a formal education in statistics and quantitative methods and a passion for coding and computing. I am comfortable using a variety of machine learning tools, and my specialty lies in causal inference, NLP, and predictive modeling. However, I continue to be enthusiastic about developing my existing skills and expanding my knowledge of the field.
