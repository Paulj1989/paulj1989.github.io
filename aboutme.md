My name is Paul Johnson. I'm a political scientist currently completing a PhD at University of Houston. My subfield is comparative politics, and I specialize in political parties, elections, and quantitative methods. My research focus is party and party system change, in particular studying the recent rise of new challenger parties.

I'm originally from the UK, and I previously attained a BA Hons in Politics at University of Sussex and an MSc in Global Politics at University of Southampton. I worked in the charity sector in London before returning to academia to become a political scientist.


I am also interested in the application of these same quantitative methods to sports, football (soccer) especially. Primarily, I write for the Borussia Dortmund and German football website, [Fear The Wall](http://www.fearthewall.com).
