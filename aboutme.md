My name is Paul Johnson. I'm a political scientist currently completing a PhD at University of Houston. My subfield is comparative politics, and I specialize in political parties, elections, and quantitative methods. My research focus is new party success and the rapid rise of new parties in established democracies and stable party systems.

I'm originally from the UK, and I previously attained a BA Hons in Politics at University of Sussex and an MSc in Global Politics at University of Southampton. I worked in the charity sector in London before returning to academia to become a political scientist.

I am also interested in the application of the quantitative methods to sports, football (soccer) especially. On occasion, I write for [Fear The Wall](http://www.fearthewall.com), applying some of the methods I use in my research to the domain of German football and Borussia Dortmund.
