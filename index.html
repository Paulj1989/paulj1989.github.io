I am studying for my PhD in Political Science at University of Houston, interested in party and party system change and quantitative methods for studying the social world.

In my spare time, I also like to apply these same methods to understand the complicated workings of football (or soccer, I'm not one of those kind of Brits). In the pursuit of a greater understanding of the sport I love, I can finally say, with complete confidence, that it is entirely random.

I'm hoping the same can't be said for my academic research.
