I have recently spent some time exploring Expected Goals (xG) over at [Fear The Wall](https://www.fearthewall.com), in a two part series that uses prediction and explanation as the basis for understanding what the popular new metric can really tell us. [Part one](https://www.fearthewall.com/2019/5/31/18646102/the-value-of-expected-goals-part-1) used monte carlo simulation and the dixon-coles model to predict a hypothetical season from the goals and the xG value from each shot in the Bundesliga last season. Following this, [part two](https://www.fearthewall.com/2019/6/7/18656210/the-value-of-expected-goals-part-2) used simple regression models to look at the variables that help us explain outcomes in football, before looking at some of the best individual performances in the BuLi last season.

Here, I'll go into a little more detail explaining the methodology behind the analysis, for those that want to get a little more into the weeds.
