My name is Paul Johnson. I'm a political scientist currently completing a PhD at University of Houston. My subfield is comparative politics, and I specialize in political parties, elections, and quantitative methods. My research focus is new party success and the rapid rise of new parties in established democracies and stable party systems.

I am also interested in the application of the quantitative methods to sports, football (soccer) especially. On occasion, I write for [Fear The Wall](http://www.fearthewall.com), applying some of the methods I use in my research to the domain of German football and Borussia Dortmund.
